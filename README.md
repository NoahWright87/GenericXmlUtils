# GenericXmlUtils
A set of handy utilities for comparing and getting statistics for XML when you don't know the structure ahead of time

## Current Work
Next up is the `CalculateFillRates` method, which will calculate how often a field is present in a collection of XMLs.

This is something that was proposed as a need by a previous job.  For now it's just a quick and dirty method that only half works.
At some point it needs to be fleshed out into something more useful.
